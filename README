Front End Challenge

Dribbble Gallery
Objective: Create a nice image gallery using the www.dribbble.com api. 

Technical Requirements
Javascript - Use Jquery, Backbone.js, and any other libraries you would like to use.
CSS - Please style these elements yourself (No css helpers please, ie bootstrap). Bonus for using CSS3 and SASS
HTML - Please write your own html (no bootstrap). Bonus for using HTML5

Instructions & Specifications (Refer to the diagram below) 
You will be creating a dribble image gallery that loads all of the data up front (popular shots, debuts, and everyone). Load the first 9 items for each list and add to it each time the user clicks “Load More”. Each tab should render the items on the page dynamically, meaning the page will never reload but rather use the data it pulled originally to create a list of images each time.

Keep in mind, all the content for the page should be rerendered when the user clicks on another tab. That means hiding and showing pages is not an acceptable solution, rather you should be using the avaialbe JSON data to render the page content based on the user’s actions.  

bonus: Load additional image using infinite scroll instead of the “load more” button.
